# Project #1

**Project: Create a Diamond Pattern in C**

**Objective:**
Write a C program that prints a diamond pattern of a specified size to the console.

**Requirements:**

1. Prompt the user to enter an odd number (representing the size of the diamond) greater than or equal to 3.
2. If the user enters an even number, display an error message and ask them to input an odd number.
3. Generate the diamond pattern using asterisks (*) or any other character of your choice.
4. The top half of the diamond should be filled with asterisks, and the bottom half should be symmetric.
5. Print the diamond pattern to the console.

EX:

diamond of size 5:

```bash
  *
 ***
*****
 ***
  *
```

**Bonus (Optional):**
Enhance your program by allowing the user to choose the character used to create the diamond pattern.

**Guidelines:**

- Use loops and conditional statements to generate and print the diamond pattern.
- Write your code in an organized and readable manner, with clear variable names and comments explaining your logic.
- Separate your code into different snippets: one for imports (if any) and one for the actual diamond pattern generation code.
- Remember to handle user input validation, ensuring the entered number is odd and greater than or equal to 3.

**Submission:**
Once you've completed your diamond pattern program, share your C source code file along with a brief explanation of how your program works and any challenges you faced during development.
